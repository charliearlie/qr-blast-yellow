## The Old Way: Static QR Codes

A static QR code has one major limitation: its destination URL is permanently encoded into the pattern. If the link breaks or you want to change the destination, you have to create and print a whole new QR code.

This creates massive headaches for businesses:
- **Printed materials become useless** if URLs change
- **No way to track performance** or gather analytics
- **Cannot update campaigns** without reprinting everything
- **Broken links** mean lost opportunities

## The Blast QR Way: Dynamic QR Codes

Dynamic QR codes are different. They point to a stable short URL managed by our service. This means you can change the final destination URL *anytime you want* without ever changing the QR code itself.

### Key Benefits:

- **Update campaigns on the fly** - Change destinations without reprinting
- **Fix broken links instantly** - Never lose traffic to dead URLs
- **Unlock powerful analytics** - Track scans, locations, devices, and more
- **A/B test destinations** - Optimise performance in real-time
- **Time-based routing** - Show different content based on when users scan
- **Geo-targeting** - Route users based on their location
